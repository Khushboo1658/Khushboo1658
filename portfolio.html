<h4>Affection</h4>
<p>I adore a wide variety of creatures, but hawks are among my favorites. I like this animal since it has the best eyesight in the world, as well as strength, endurance, and hearing. All raptors share a tight relationship with the hawk. Similar to a normal bird, the hawk has eyes on the sides of its head that allow it to see all around. The hawk is a bird of prey, which sets it apart from other types of birds.

<h5>About nature</h5>
<p>
 Being an ecologist, I enjoy viewing picturesque scenes of lovely nature since I believe that it provides oxygen, sunlight, soil, water, and other essential components, as well as lowering stress and anxiety and reducing the chance of depression. Nature is made up of both living and non-living objects, and because everyone depends on one another, the ecosystem is kept in balance. All living things, including humans, animals, and plants, need on nature to survive.
